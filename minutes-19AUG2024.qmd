## Agenda
1. Review of Google Cloud Storage bucket organization and contents
2. Discussion of DEM derivatives and flow accumulation
3. Review of covariate development progress
4. Discussion of tiling strategy

## Discussion

### Google Cloud Storage Organization
Matt Macander provided an overview of the bucket organization:
- **Sentinel Data**: Contains Sentinel-1 and Sentinel-2 composites
  - Sentinel-2 composites cover 2019-2023
  - Data organized in 5 seasonal windows (spring, early summer, midsummer, late summer, fall)
  - Tiled in 50km x 50km blocks using Alaska Albers projection
  - Fire disturbance effects noted in recent burn areas
- **Topography**: Contains statewide 10-meter DEM
- **Covariates**: Contains DEM derivatives and other analytical products

### Flow Accumulation and DEM Processing
Colby Brungard presented his approach to DEM processing and flow accumulation:
- Processing by HUC-8 watersheds with 4km buffers
- Trim back to remove edge effects while maintaining 250m overlap
- Key challenges identified:
  - Artifacts in major river channels due to elevation data limitations
  - Issues with islands and river features in flow accumulation
- Processing steps include:
  - Filling single-cell sinks
  - Least cost breaching algorithm with 100m buffer
  - Additional single-cell pit removal pass

### Covariate Development Progress
Colby demonstrated numerous terrain derivatives being developed:
1. **Terrain Ruggedness Indices**
   - Calculated at 4, 16, and 32 pixel neighborhoods
   - Removed 2 and 8 pixel calculations as they didn't capture useful patterns

2. **Topographic Position Index**
   - Multiple scale calculations (4, 16, 32 pixels)

3. **Wetness Indices**
   - Saga Wetness Index with different sections
   - Stream Power Index

4. **Solar Radiation**
   - Direct and diffuse radiation calculations
   - Computed for solstices and monthly intervals
   - 24-hour integration periods

5. **Additional Metrics**
   - Profile and plan curvature
   - Positive and negative openness
   - Vector ruggedness measure
   - Height above channel network
   - Valley depth
   - Geomorphons

### Tiling Strategy Discussion
- Current sentinel data is tiled in 50km x 50km blocks
- Discussion of whether to tile DEM derivatives similarly
- Advantages of tiling identified:
  - Better RAM management for processing
  - Enables parallel processing
  - Consistent with existing data organization
- Decision to proceed with tiling approach, following Matt and Tim's existing structure

## Decisions and Action Items
1. Colby will:
   - Mosaic and upload flow accumulation data as first test case
   - Test tiling workflow on flow accumulation layer
   - Continue developing remaining covariates

2. Team will:
   - Compare flow accumulation results with existing water mask
   - Review Tim's wetness index approach
   - Further discuss tiling strategy via email

3. Nic will:
   - Obtain access to the Google Cloud bucket
   - Create and distribute meeting minutes
   - Follow up on email chain with action items

## Next Steps
- Review flow accumulation results with water mask overlay
- Evaluate tiling workflow effectiveness
- Continue covariate development with regular updates
- Next regularly scheduled monthly meeting scheduled for September 13th, 2024
