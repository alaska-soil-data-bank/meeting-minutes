## Project Updates

### Data Integration Progress

#### NASIS Data Analysis
- Analysis of recent NASIS snapshot shows significant improvement in data coverage:
  - 34,661 total records with unique pedon ID
  - 34,029 records have unique geometry (lat/long)
  - Approximately double the number of pedon records compared to 2020 snapshot (~17,000)
  - Comprehensive taxonomic classification analysis completed

#### Taxonomic Classification
- Analysis of soil orders and suborders completed
- Notable findings:
  - One unusual Oxisol pedon record near Homer (likely an error)
  - Approximately 4,000 records without taxonomic classification
- Special attention being paid to permafrost-affected soils and Gelisol classification
  - Records from pre-1999 (before Gelisol order established) being reviewed
  - Many older records have been reclassified in recent years

#### Permafrost Depth and Thaw Depth Data Management
- Discussion of permafrost table depth and thaw depth documentation:
  - No standardized field in NASIS for permafrost/thaw depth
  - Currently using F suffix and site notes for identification
  - Following Neal Pastick's 2015 paper approach:
    - Using presence/absence within one meter
    - Filtering by observation date for maximum thaw depth
    - Mid-July suggested as optimal observation time

### Data Integration Efforts

#### Forest Service Data Integration
- Progress on matching Forest Service records with NASIS:
  - Direct ID matching found ~200 matches
  - Spatial joining (2m buffer) with fuzzy ID matching found ~2,500 matches
  - Discussion of potentially reducing buffer to 5m based on previous studies

#### Carbon Data Integration
- Analysis of ISCN 3 (2022 snapshot) integration:
  - 2,720 total records
  - ~1,100-1,200 records overlap with NASIS or UAF archive
  - Approximately 200 novel carbon records identified

#### WOSIS Integration
- 2,300 records in Alaska
- High overlap with ISCN dataset
- Only 10-20 novel points identified

### Technical Progress

#### Covariate Development
- Colby Brungard reported on DEM derivatives:
  - Final 3 HUC8 watersheds being processed
  - Expected completion within 4 days
  - Total dataset size estimated at 12.5 TB (compressed)
  - Will be tiled following same pattern as spectral data

#### Data Storage and Access
- Successfully established secure data storage on Minnesota Supercomputing Institute platform
- Public access options identified for sharing outputs
- Ability to create publicly accessible storage buckets for sharing preliminary results

## Timeline and Next Steps

### Immediate Goals
- Complete covariate processing and integration
- Finalize data quality checks and taxonomic updates
- Begin preliminary modeling runs by November

### Focus Areas
1. pH mapping (most data available)
2. Carbon data integration (requires additional processing)
3. Soil classification at order/suborder level

## Action Items

1. Nic to:
   - Email identified team members by Monday for follow-up discussions
   - Share meeting slides and update meeting minutes
   - Connect with computer science team members next week

2. Denise and Nic to:
   - Consult with field staff about historical permafrost table and thaw depth documentation practices

3. Colby to:
   - Complete final HUC8 watershed processing
   - Mosaic and tile DEM derivatives
   - Upload processed data to shared bucket

## Next Meeting

The November meeting time will be shifted due to teaching conflicts. December meeting will remain at regular time.
