    "section": "8.4 Discussion",
    "text": "8.4 Discussion\n\n8.4.1 Covariate Resolution\nColby Brungard led the discussion on developing covariates for the Alaska Soil Data Bank project. The current NRCS agreement states that the project will deliver statewide soil class predictions at 30-meter resolution. However, some team members are working on projects requiring 10-meter resolution data. The question is whether to develop covariates at 10 meters based on the resampled, harmonized 10-meter IFSAR data from Timm and Matt, which would set the stage for bringing in imagery at the same resolution, or to use 30-meter resolution for faster computing times and smaller file sizes.\nMatt Macander suggested starting with 30-meter resolution to work out any issues in the process and then consider producing both resolutions, as many terrain metrics can be averaged or aggregated from 10 to 30 meters. Sabine Grunwald noted that finer resolution does not necessarily mean better models, and it is a trade-off between computational time and perceived benefits.\n\n\n8.4.2 Data Sources\nTravis Nauman brought up the question of data sources, particularly the challenges with IFSAR data in densely vegetated areas. Alternative data sources such as Copernicus and ASTER were discussed. However, Timm Nawrocki and Francis Biles confirmed that despite its challenges, IFSAR is substantially better than any alternative providing holistic coverage for Alaska.\nFrancis Biles cautioned about the limitations of IFSAR in southeast Alaska and Kodiak Island, where vegetation removal and accuracy issues persist. Timm Nawrocki added that manual corrections would be needed for high-quality stream networks across the state, but IFSAR remains the best available option for full state coverage.\n\n\n8.4.3 Terrain Derivatives\nThe group agreed to move forward with IFSAR at a resampled, harmonized 10-meter resolution statewide. Colby Brungard has scripts to calculate 40-43 terrain covariates with different parameter settings, resulting in nearly 200 covariates. These include slope, curvature, potential incoming solar radiation, mass balance index, and wetness index.\n\n\n8.4.4 Follow-on Projects\nParticipants discussed their requirements for potential follow-on projects:\n\nJosh Minai: Currently using 30-meter resolution for mapping carbon stocks, nitrogen, and soil properties statewide due to data density considerations.\nNeal Pastick: The choice of resolution depends on the temporal resolution and the target variable (dynamic vs. static).\nMatt Macander: Targeting 10-meter resolution for statewide vegetation mapping to capture fine-scale patterns, while using 30-meter Landsat data for time series analysis.\nTimm Nawrocki: Having both a current 10-meter snapshot and a 30-year time series at 30-meter resolution would be beneficial.\nFrancis Biles: Having the option of both resolutions would be useful for USFS projects.",

    "text": "11.3 Discussion on USFS Soil Data\nJacquie Foss (USFS)) shared that they have a large amount of legacy soil pedon data that has not been digitized. This includes detailed pedon descriptions from over 1000 sites across southeast Alaska. Currently this data exists as PDFs and scanned field sheets stored on a Sharepoint site that is difficult to access and utilize.\nThere was extensive discussion around options to make this valuable soil data more accessible. Jacquie expressed interest in an intake solution that resembles the standard soil pedon field sheets to facilitate entering the data. Travis discussed the NCSS PedonPC Excel template and Survey123 as potential options that provide import capability to NASIS. However, he noted there is no consensus on the best approach across different soil data collectors.\nThe group discussed the challenges around obsolete soil horizon nomenclature and taxonomy used in older surveys. Manual transcription would be needed in many cases along with lookup tables to translate to modern terminology. Colby Brungard shared his experience leading a student project to digitize over 3000 legacy pedons in New Mexico. He offered to briefly present on this project in an upcoming meeting to share lessons learned.\nIn terms of next steps, Jacquie will upload their available digitized soil data to the Box folder shared by Nic. Follow up side discussions will also take place exploring options to transform the legacy PDF data into accessible electronic records. Nic suggested exploring use of undergraduate researchers to assist with transcription of select records within the project timeframe.",

IfSar can have issues in forested areas. ERA5 land data could also be an option.\n\n\n12.3.3 Model Inputs\n\nFor climate data, downscaled PRISM is a good statewide option. Alternate sources mentioned were SNAP and ERA5 land products.\nIncorporating remote sensing data could help capture pre/post disturbance conditions if site data is timestamped appropriately.\n\n\n\n12.3.4 Model Outputs\nWhile initial modeling may focus more on soil taxonomy, properties like organic layer thickness will also emerge as interesting continuous outputs not specified in the agreement.

They use NRCS database but also curate their own pedon data thats not into the NRCS database, feel it will integrate with our project well. They have ~50 pedon data in peatlands which is much greater than NRCS available data atm.\nHave ensemble model paper coming out soon on predicting carbon stocks soon. Comprehensive model for all western us states alaska & hawaii, and may include some canadian pedon data\nNic follow-up questions for Dave Upcoming paper is about evaluating error in point based carbon stocks? D - How good is any one model doing, if we combine all of it and aggregate error, to determine a mean, allow for model comparison against the aggregate. D - Not necessarily better or worse than individual model but allows for comparison D - Interested in C/N ration J - CN ratio, difficult with co-variates…. Also map C and N individually then compare C/N ratio VS mapping CN directly What was the input datasets for the paper in review? SSURGO, G-SOCK??(sp), WOSIS, Northern Circumpolar, ? , ?, McNicke?, Statsgo, canadian soil carbon, N - State effort in MN, starting on lowland conifer and peat predictions, Randy Kolka mentioned a larger program is that related to Dave’s project? D - no? D’s project is specific to SE alaska, but tries to collect as much data as possible D - Grant Domke (northern usfs research station) – Improve FIA soil approach, switch is rudimentary… N - Josh, do you know the datasets that ummakant used that were alaska databases that went into his model? J - NRCS …. Not as much access to data was a challenge, but potentially got data from russians. J has data that is X,Y and SOC stocks, depth of active layer – no metadata, julie may know others with w/ original data. J - Access to more data and share data w/ others…. Can share what he’s done next time, has created 30m (GSIM? IFSAR?) J - 5m would be too many pixels to predict on N - goal is carbon and … pointers to different datasets This project raw data intact and tagging metadata tags Controlled vocabular taxonomy, with a set of tags for each field in metadata sets, and we will use scripts to query based on tags. Will maintain a raw dataset that points back to repo/source and improving metadata. Harmonizing data will be a secondary step Ideally, the datasets will be useful in future applications as well D - NSF grant w/ canadian and us to harmonize data so a good start in crossing political boundaries, a working group of people has been established D - better to centralize in a repository at AKSDB vs handing off to individual researchers/groups which is good for transparency D - IFSAR in moist wet mountainous steep terrain is difficult Testing across steep slopes you start seeing “bathtubs” from clearcuts, artifacts from canopy heights. Pushing towards lidar Careful where to apply the IFSAR J - GDM 34m…. Seems to be ok “Nic gives you candy before the diagnosis” J - thinking about going coarser for CN prediction data N - going to go through points",

Where did coords come from and what is the precision of coordinates? Matt: Recent data has estimates to meters of accuracy reported by GPS.\nMatt: Define Default units for each row, then define a translation factor.\nMajor action items:\n\nIrf & Nic getting a preliminary draft with minimum standards\nColby share draft scheme for tagging dataset quality… “gps pre 2000, gps post 2000, from ortho photos..”\n\n\nLooking Forward: Future Meetings\n\nFEB: Discuss minimum standards requirements\nMARCH: Potentially invite GEMS and NRCS to meeting\nMatt - Questions about previously submitted data sets.

Next AK 2026 taskforce meeting is January 20th.\nEnsure subawards contracts are executed. ABR contract is now completed and ready for invoicing. NMSU and UFL subawards have been executed by UMN and sent to sponsored projects at each institution (Nic double checked).\nSchedule monthly recurring meetings – second Friday of each month (beginning January 13th) @ 9am AK, 11am Mountain, 12PM Central, 1PM Eastern. Will keep this schedule at least through May – then will re-evaluate for the field season and fall.\n\n\n\n24.1.2 Discussion on executing Deliverable #1:\n\nThe Alaska Soil Data Bank (ASDB). We will acquire, curate, and centralize non-NRCS legacy data for the state of Alaska and stand up a database for continuing contributions on the G.E.M.S. platform of the University of Minnesota Supercomputing Institute. The ASDB will result in a harmonized dataset for use in digital soil mapping in Alaska and scripts will be written to export the data into a NASIS-readable format for ingestion.\n\nMajor action items:\n\nNeed to get Sabine, Matt and Colby set up as GEMS users.\nNic needs to set up a new project team and workspace in GEMS – currently working with GEMS team to do this. GEMS has streamlined the user addition process now – one question that came up for partners – should we use one login per instutition? The answer is no – we should use individualized logins for every user because this is now further streamlined and can be attached to a specific Globus ID\nOnce everyone is set up as users and our team is set up, Nic can pull everyone in to the project. I can add new users at any team once they are registered.\n\n\nGeneral discussion regarding path forward on deliverable 1\n\nAgreed that we should move forward in January with reviewing 2 test datasets on the GEMS platform – for the January meeting, Nic will walk through data import, field metadata tagging, dataset or project metadata generation in GEMS, and scripting capabilities in the workspace.\n\nWe will look at Chien-Lu’s UAF pedon database and a snippet of the ABR legacy database\n\nConcurrently, we will begin drafting metadata architecture for the project. We will have should have this set prior to large scale data ingestion, and aim to have a first version of a full metadata document complete by May 2023 or before. Sabine will share the full metadata documentation for the Florida Soil Characterization Database.\n\nSome additional considerations for developing metadata architecture:\n\nVersion control\n\nGithub? Or work on GEMS platform in JSON? - that may be limited so perhaps work on GitHub in JSON?\nAdditionally, it may be easiest for our full project metadata to be in a more easily editable form – while dataset specific metadata can utilize the GEMS metadata creation tools, which generate JSON formatted metadata.\n\nNeed to draft data conventions: decide how to handle missing data, missing values, etc etc. Were variables not assesed due to the sampling protocol or actually missing? Are missing fields null or zero values, etc\nDealing with different coordinate systems.\nOntologies/ controlled vocabularies for field metadata – we can create a controlled vocabulary/ontology that is specific to our project for appending field metadata. Nic would work with GEMS engineers to set this up.\n\nSome additional considerations for wrangling datasets\n\nWhat format? Text files? Database exchange\n\nNic’s first thought is we should work in csvs for most datasets. Although there is no restriction to file types in GEMS this would likely be the cleanest. Can look into database exchange options for the ABR database.\n\nAssigning unique IDs to all observations in datasets, checking for duplicates, etc\n\nThis is something that can be done in the workspace on GEMS – we need to think about site vs horizon level data – need to link with ID (ABR uses a project ID and a plot ID.\n\nColby has dealt with unique identifiers in combined datasets by appending the UTM coordinates to observations.",

From Sabine: we develop memoranda of understanding and agreement as well as implement data policies. This should include co-authorship policies. We should have a letter standardized - all those contribute using data policy. Makes it easier to answer for later - to have something in written form. Should do this with agencies as well – even if data is public. \n- How does data ownership work with NASIS - how would data ownership be honored. Some of the academics that might have datasest - how will the data be shared through NASIS with other potential users? \n- This process needs to incorporate the NRCS folks.   \n\nc. From Colby - hard copy data from Forest Service BLM, NRCS \n- Should contact Jay Scoblin: NRCS - knows how to get data into NASIS - did a giant export from the forest service NRS database into NASIS.  \n\nd. From Matt: ABR has asset in Google Earth Engine for statewide covariates \n- Colby also has co-variates on statewide basis? \n\ne. From Sabine - use some of existing data in terms of horizons and profiles to think of an inference AI model that is able to make predictions from topsoil to lower layers. To use environmental co-variates and topsoil information to make deeper predictions with AI model. Because this would be very interesting with landscape changes - what would happen as warming develops further in the future. \n- Will we include data from proximal soil sensing/spectral data, etc? \n  - Thats the fantastic AI dataset that we could explore - if you had mid IR scan, but didn't know horizonation - could you determine horizons - could you get to horizon nomenclature - would be something to explore - proxys and softer datasets. \n  - ISRIC - standardized soil images, soil profiles - create consistent images - images exist from soil profiles, soil properties, so you can match the image to the properties.

I am currently between fieldwork but would like to hold a short check-in during our normal scheduled time this Friday, August 11th (Zoom link below if you don’t have it). I know many folks may not be able to attend, but if you are able please do and we can make it short.\nI am including Dave D’Amore and Jacquie Foss (USFS) as well as Timm Nawrocki (Alaska Center for Conservation Science) as I would like to give the three of them visibility over our work in the context of this project as they will be contributing data and potentially be co-authors in the future. Dave, Jacquie and Timm - please feel free to join if you are able - if not, no worries - full meetings will resume monthly in September (second Friday of each month) and we would love to have you join as you are able.\nThe main points of discussion I would like to address are updates on data curation, GEMS, and general check-ins/setting the objectives for the fall.\nTime (Friday, 8/11): 9AM AK (Matt & Sue & Mike & Dave & Timm & Jacquie) 11AM Mountain (Colby) 12PM Central (Nic & Irf) 1PM Eastern (Sabine)\nAgenda: 1.

    "text": "Hi Everyone -\nCancel June Meeting. My sincerest apologies but due to some unanticipated fieldwork & travel I need to cancel our June project meeting (originally scheduled for tomorrow, Friday, June 9th). I’m sure many others are otherwise occupied as well. Instead, I will provide project updates by the end of the June to everyone. Current action items (in brief) are to: 1. Complete draft of data sharing agreement (Nic) 2. Complete wrangling of preliminary datasets into GEMS (Irf) 3. Continue to pursue/expand data wrangling efforts (Nic, Irf, All). In that vein, I have asked Dave D’Amore (USFS Alaska) to join our group as USFS will be contributing quite a load of data and Dave has expressed interest in participating. If anyone has objections to this please let me know.\nEUCOP Poster. Finally, I will be attending EUCOP as part of another project but am presenting a poster on our project. It is more a “project overview” poster than a results poster at this point. See initial draft attached - please let me know if you would like to see any changes by Monday @ 10:00AM (I will print Monday afternoon).\nSabine: Could you send me an approved UF logo for use? Colby: Is the NMSU logo OK? Matt & Sue: Could you send me the current ABR logo (I think the one I put on there is old?).\nThank you all!\nAKSDB Poster DRAFT Updated w Figures 08JUN2023.pdf\nRespectfully, Nic",

Most sections are incomplete, and there are potentially many other sections to add, but it is a start that we can work on. Remember that this is our project level metadata, and not dataset-level metadata, which will be managed in GEMS.\nEveryone: If you have a chance please at least briefly scroll through the document and familiarize yourself with the structure. In the meeting we will have time to review and documents any critiques, questions or things you would like to see added.\nSabine: If you have any comments please feel free to send them to me directly and I will incorporate them into our notes. I am especially interested in your perspectives on authorship guidelines/data contributions. We are just starting this conversation this month, so will have plenty of other opportunities to discuss in the future.\nTime (Friday, 2/10): 9AM AK (Matt & Sue & Mike) 11AM Mountain (Colby) 12PM Central (Nic) 1PM Eastern (Sabine) - Sabine will not be in attendance at this meeting\nAgenda: 1.

Much appreciated!\nGitHub Organization Created: After some consideration I have decided to move all of our project coordination from Box to a GitHub organization called “alaska-soil-data-bank” with multiple repos (currently all set as private) under it. I have migrated everything to GitHub and will no longer be maintaining our Box shared folder. There are several advantages to this:\n\n\nWe can publish our project-related documentation and repos publicly once we are ready.\nWe can develop our project metadata as a publicly accessible book published through GitHub Pages - here is a rough example: https://alaska-soil-data-bank.github.io/project-metadata/\nI can manage meeting minutes and updates as Discussions to create a running archive, and Todos can be managed as Issues. You will see I have already done this for our previous content under “Discussions”. TODO: Colby, Sabine and Irf - I found your GitHub profiles and invited you to the organization: let me know if you don’t see the invites. Matt - I couldn’t find you on GitHub - could you sign up for and account and/or send me your username? Then I will add you to the organization so you can access repos.",

I added the minutes of yesterdays discussion to our running minutes document in the Box folder: https://umn.box.com/s/xjp7icv7ki3jjdqfmeuwrlrjwe8bwmct. All of my substantive group emails will now start with [AKSDB 00X] (with increasing numbers in sequence) so that I can easily keep a running record of important communications.\nAction items. The following action items should be completed before the end of December if possible:\n\n\nEveryone -\n\nplease sign up as a GEMS Open user here: https://gems.agroinformatics.org/webui. Click on the “Sign up to GEMS Open” box and follow instructions (Colby already did this as a test case with his OrchidID (other options as well) and it worked. Once you are approved users I can pull you into my GEMS “Team” which is specific to our project. Send me an email once you have done this so I can look to see if I can see you as a user in the GEMS system.\n\nSabine -\n\nplease send me any metadata documentation you have related to the Florida Soil Characterization Database and/or data handling conventions.\n\nMatt -\n\nplease send me any metadata documentation you have related to the ABR legacy database and/or data handling conventions;\nplease generate a “snippet” or small example dataset that would be representative of structure/fields for the ABR database and send to me. For now, csv will be the best format - can include project and plot data + metadata as separate files (and also soil horizon level as a separate file if that exists for some projects).\n\n\n\nJanuary meeting. For our January meeting, I will go over data ingestion, metadata editing/creation in GEMS using two example datasets (Chien-Lu Ping’s UAF soil characterization database + ABR legacy database snippet from Matt). The GEMS interface and workspace continue to advance significantly and I think the existing and new functionality will serve our needs quite well. Specifically:\n\nThere are excellent tools for appending field metadata - including fuzzy matching based on data types and column headings.\nWe can set up our own project specific ontology/controlled vocabulary in GEMS for field metadata - I can work with GEMS engineers to do this.\nThe GEMS platform tools for generating consistent metadata in JSON format for each dataset are well advanced and easy to use.\nThe GEMS workspace allows us to script in Python or R. I am going to default to R since that is what I use the most and also what we will be using for the DSM work (Deliverable 2).\nAlthough there are excellent tools in GEMS for generating JSON metadata for every dataset, I think we are going to need a more flexible and expansive format for our database level metadata architecture. I may look into setting up a GitHub project for this purpose so that we can have version control and maximum transparency - unless someone has a better suggestion.\n\n\nRespectfully, Nic",

I set up a When2Meet to try and find a 1 hr block of time to meet on either 12DEC, 13DEC, or 14DEC - I hope one of these days will work - if not I will suggest alternate dates.
