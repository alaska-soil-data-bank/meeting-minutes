## Project Updates

### Administrative Updates

- No-cost extension approval received, extending the project through September 30th, 2025
  - Team agreed to treat May 2025 as an effective end date due to summer field season
- All three semi-annual reports are now available in the reporting folder on GitHub
  - First two reports were text entries in NRCS EasyFed grants portal
  - Most recent April report was submitted as a PDF
- Project GitHub page continues to be updated with meeting minutes and other documentation

### Data Acquisition and Management

#### New Data Status
- No new data acquisition since April meeting
- Ongoing work with USGS and AVA (Stefanie and Neil Pastick) regarding geotech logs
- Private data transfer from AEA pending completion of data agreements
  - Additional form required due to University of Minnesota system changes in March/April
  - Data expected to be in similar format to previous ABR deliveries

#### Southeast Alaska Data
- Dave D'Amore reported second and third papers published on Southeast Alaska data
- New pedons will be migrated to the database soon
- Data can be provided in any format through the Box folder

#### Forest Service Data
- Follow-up needed with Jacquie regarding shape file for soil/vegetation site descriptions
- Frances Biles to assist with follow-up by end of June/early July

### Technical Progress

#### Covariate Development
- Colby Brungard reported progress on covariate processing:
  - Using WhiteBox tools for hydrologic preprocessing
  - Implemented pit removal and least-cost breach depression processing
  - Alaska divided into 6 watersheds for processing
  - Entire Yukon basin (all 3 parts) merged into one unit
  - Processing expected to take approximately one month

#### Imagery and Spectral Data
- Decision made to use Sentinel imagery
- Matt Macander reported on status:
  - Current tiles available through summer 2022 on Google Cloud Storage
  - Update in progress for more recent coverage
  - Includes 5 seasonal windows during snow-free season for Sentinel-2
  - Sentinel-1 includes 3 seasonal windows (summer, deep winter, fall)
  - Team agreed to proceed with updates since modeling won't begin immediately

### Timeline and Goals

- Preliminary model runs and predictive maps targeted for end of August 2024
  - Acknowledged as "extremely preliminary" but meant to demonstrate functional system
- Data integration and preparation continuing through July
- Mapping work targeting May 2025 completion
- Planning to address data export and NASIS integration starting May 2025

## Future Collaborations and Opportunities

### Woodwell Climate Institute
- Discussion of potential collaboration with Woodwell Climate Institute's Permafrost Pathways project
- Project works with Western Alaska villages needing spatial data on soils and permafrost
- Previous NSF proposal (CHIRP) not invited for full submission
- Potential for postdoc position to support modeling work

### AI Climate Institute
- New USDA-funded AI institute at University of Minnesota
- Focus includes land-atmosphere interactions in cold regions
- Potential for collaboration on integrated numerical models
- Opportunities for knowledge-guided machine learning approaches
- Funded by USDA NIFA with additional partner agencies

## Action Items

1. Nic to:
   - Complete University of Minnesota data transfer agreement process
   - Create Google Sheet for tracking covariates (using personal account for broader access)
   - Follow up with Jacquie/Frances regarding soil/vegetation site shape files
   
2. Matt and Tim to:
   - Continue work on Sentinel imagery updates
   - Plan process for moving spectral covariates into modeling environment

3. Colby to:
   - Continue processing terrain derivatives
   - Expected completion in approximately one month

4. Frances to:
   - Follow up on Forest Service shape file by early July

## Next Meeting

Next meeting will be July 12th, 2024
