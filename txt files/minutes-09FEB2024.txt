- Key repos to access:
  - Project meeting minutes and archived recordings: https://alaska-soil-data-bank.github.io/meeting-minutes/
  - Project metadata and documentation : https://alaska-soil-data-bank.github.io/project-metadata/
- Co-authorship agreement included in metadata

### Action Items Review
- Timm to deliver AIM/BLM & adjacent datasets before field season
- Matt & Sue finalizing data sharing agreements with private entities
- USFS team migrating data to shared Box folder
- Potential future call with Colby on digitization approaches 

### Data Curation Updates
- Wrangling legacy pedon data from Northern Alaska (~200 viable data points)
- Acquiring ~100 pedons from Copper River Basin & Yukon Delta
- Finalizing access for 1,700+ pedons from private datasets  
- Migrating multiple USFS legacy datasets (20+ pedons so far) 
- Gathering additional USFS descriptive scans (8,000+)
- Integrating geotechnical borehole data (permafrost/ground-ice focused)
- Current total count nearing 7,000 pedons, much not in existing databases

### NRCS Data Templates  
- Travis reviewing updated PedonPC template for standard data formatting
- Will distribute once finalized

### Science Products Discussion
- Current agreement deliverables:
  - Centralized Alaska Soil Data Bank - data papaer
  - Manuscript on approach, architecture, and content
  - Statewide soil order/suborder predictions at 30m resolution - soil mapping paper
- Opportunities:
  - Expand modeling variables based on available data
  - Develop hierarchical modeling approach
  - Enable periodic model updates as new data added
  - Integrate temporal data on fire/climate
  - Explore additional components like ground ice and permafrost
- Follow-on Work
  - Develop collaborative proposals for extended analyses
  - Engage partners at USGS, NSF, and other agencies
  - Continue discussions on scientific possibilities

### Project Timeline  
- Targeting completion of initial databank and statewide property modeling by Fall 2024
- Planning no-cost extension through September 2025 to enable further analyses

## Action Items
- Nic to schedule call with NCRS team and agreement PIs/CoPIs
- Nic to share data modeling template once finalized

## Next Meeting
The next meeting is scheduled for March 8th, 2024.
